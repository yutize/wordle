## Self-Reflection:

- **How long it took me to finish this?**
  It took me around a week to finish

- **What do you think of this completion time?**
  I believe that it was good because I am still elarning the ropes back to Javascript and some stuff took me a while to figure out via logic or syntax

- **In hindsight, what would you do differently?**
  Plan out the whole thing better rather than just do one part at a time. If I planned out the logic then it would make my mound of code less confusing

- **What resources did you use?**
  ChatGPT to help explain some errors and how logic worked for some parts
